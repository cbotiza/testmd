        <h2>TestMD: Fast Integration Testing for Java</h2>

        <p><b>"Unit Tests"</b> run fast&mdash;but to be fast they must mock all external systems at the expense of
            proving your integration is correct</p>

        <p><b>"Integration Tests"</b> prove interaction are correct&mdash;but require external dependencies and take too
            long to run</p>

        <p><b>TestMD</b> gives you the speed of unit testing with the validity of integration testing by tracking how
            the actual integration is done and performing time-consuming interactions IF AND ONLY IF there has been a
            change</p>

                <p>Found a change in logic but cannot run the automated tests with your setup? Accepted results can be committed marked as "unverified" and future runs
                    will attempt to verify them automatically until successful.</p>
